# Visual-Planning-Tool
An interactive 'Gantt-like' chart for visualising project and portfolio information 

Time based activity attributes are grouped on the y-axis and the layout is optimised to reduce the overall size of the chart.  The aim in most cases is to create a project or portfolio 'view on a page'.   
Zoom exposes or hides text that doesn't fit inside the timeline bars and allows exploration of the plan in combination with the chart drag function.   Bars can be individually re-sized or moved and the optimised layout is refreshed automatically.
Later versions will enable groups of bars to move relative to the selected bar e.g. if the whole plan is time delayed.
Addition functionality will be added including combination with a grid e.g. slickgrid to add and edit activities
